Can\n      // also be 0-based or 1-based.\n      currentPage: 2,\n\n      // Required under server-mode\n      totalRecords: 200\n    },\n\n    // You can configure the mapping from a `Backbone.PageableCollection#state`\n    // key to the query string parameters accepted by your server API.\n    queryParams: {\n\n      // `Backbone.PageableCollection#queryParams` converts to ruby's\n      // will_paginate keys by default.\n      currentPage: \"current_page\",\n      pageSize: \"page_size\"\n    }\n  });\n\n\nYou can initialize ``state`` and ``queryParams`` from the constructor too:\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n   var Books = Backbone.PageableCollection.extend({\n     model: Book,\n     url:\"api.mybookstore.com/books\"\n   });\n\n   var books = new Books([], {\n\n     // All the `state` and `queryParams` key value pairs are merged with\n     // the defaults too.\n     state: {\n       firstPage: 0,\n       currentPage: 0\n     },\n\n     queryParams: {\n       currentPage: \"current_page\",\n       pageSize: \"page_size\"\n     }\n   });\n\n\nAdapting to a Server API\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTo adapt to an existing server API that do not use ``will_paginate`` keys, you\ncan configure the ``queryParams`` object hash to map ``state`` keys to the query\nparameters your server will accept. Those query parameters will be in the query\nstring of the URL used for fetching. You can also put extra items into\n``queryParams`` and they will be in the query string as is. Setting ``null`` as\nthe value of any mapping will remove it from the query string. Finally, the\nvalues in the ``queryParams`` can be either a literal value or a parameter-less\nfunction that returns a value.\n\nThis is a listing of the default ``state`` and ``queryParam`` values.\n\n============ ===== ============= ============================\n    ``state``                   ``queryParams``\n------------------ ------------------------------------------\nAttribute    Value Attribute     Value\n============ ===== ============= ============================\nfirstPage    1\nlastPage     null\ncurrentPage  null  currentPage   \"page\"\npageSize     25    pageSize      \"per_page\"\ntotalPages   null  totalPages    \"total_pages\"\ntotalRecords null  totalRecords  \"total_entries\"\nsortKey      null  sortKey       \"sort_by\"\norder        -1    order         \"order\"\n\\                  directions    { \"-1\": \"asc\", \"1\": \"desc\" }\n============ ===== ============= ============================\n\nYou can consult the `API documentation\n<http://wyuenho.github.com/backbone-pageable/#!/api/Backbone.PageableCollection>`_\nfor a detailed explaination of these fields.\n\nFetching Data and Managing States\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nYou can access the pageable collection's internal state by looking at the\n``state`` object attached to it. This state object, however, is generally\nread-only after initialization. There are various methods to help you manage\nthis state, you should use them instead of manually modifying it. For the\nunusual circumstances where you need to modify the ``state`` object directly, a\nsanity check will be performed at the next time you perform any\npagination-specific operations to ensure internal state consistency.\n\n======================== ===============================================\nMethod                   Use When\n======================== ===============================================\n``setPageSize``          Changing the page size\n``setSorting``           Changing the sorting\n``switchMode``           Switching between modes\n``state``                Need to read the internal state\n``get*Page``             Need to go to a different page\n``hasPrevious, hasNext`` Check if paging backward or forward is possible\n======================== ===============================================\n\nIn addition to the above methods, you can also synchronize the state with the\nserver during a fetch. ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` overrides the default\n`Backbone.Collection#parse <http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-parse>`_ method to\nsupport an additional response data structure that contains an object hash of\npagination state. The following is a table of the response data structure\nformats ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` accepts.\n\n============= ====================================\nWithout State With State\n============= ====================================\n[{}, {}, ...] [{ pagination state }, [{}, {} ...]]\n============= ====================================\n\nBootstrapping\n-------------\n\n``Backbone.PageableCollection`` is 100% compatible with ``Backbone.Collection``\n's interface, so you can bootstrap the models and supply a comparator to the\nconstructor just like you are used to:\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n  // Bootstrap with just 1 page of data for server-mode, or all the pages for\n  // client-mode.\n  var books = new Books([\n    { name: \"A Tale of Two Cities\" },\n    { name: \"Lord of the Rings\" },\n    // ...\n  ], {\n    // Paginate and sort on the client side, default is `server`.\n    mode: \"client\",\n    // This will maintain the current page in the order the comparator defined\n    // on the client-side, regardless of modes.\n    comparator: function (model) { return model.get(\"name\"); }\n  });\n\n\nPagination\n----------\n\nServer-Mode\n+++++++++++\n\n``Backbone.Pagination`` defaults to server-mode, which means it only holds one\npage of data at a time. All of the ``get*page`` operations are done by\ndelegating to ``fetch``. They return a ``jqXHR`` in this mode.\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n  books.getFirstPage();\n  books.getPreviousPage();\n  books.getNextPage();\n  books.getLastPage();\n\n  // All the `get*Page` methods under server-mode delegates to `fetch`, so you\n  // can attach a callback to the returned `jqXHR` objects' `done` event.\n  books.getPage(2).done(function () {\n    // do something ...\n  });\n\n\nAll of the ``get*Page`` methods accept the same options\n`Backbone.Collection#fetch <http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-fetch>`_ accepts\nunder server-mode.\n\n\nClient-Mode\n+++++++++++\n\nClient-mode is a very convenient mode for paginating a handful of pages entirely\non the client side without going through the network page-by-page. This mode is\nbest suited if you only have a small number of pages so sending all of the data\nto the client is not too time-consuming.\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n  var book = new Book([\n    // Bootstrap all the records for all the pages here\n  ], { mode: \"client\" });\n\n\nAll of the ``get*Page`` methods reset the pageable collection's data to the models\nbelonging to the current page and return the collection itself instead of a\n``jqXHR``.\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n  // You can immediately operate on the collection without waiting for jQuery to\n  // call your `done` callback.\n  var json = JSON.stringify(books.getLastPage());\n\n  // You can force a fetch in client-mode to get the most updated data if the\n  // collection has gone stale.\n  books.getFirstPage({ fetch: true });\n\n  // Do something interesting with books...\n\n\nInfinite-Mode\n+++++++++++++\n\nInfinite paging mode is a hybrid of server mode and client mode. Once\ninitialized and bootstrapped, paging backwards will be done on the client-side\nby default while paging forward will be done by fetching.\n\nAs before, you can make use of ``getFirstPage``, ``getPreviousPage``,\n``getNextPage``, and ``getLastPage`` for navigation under infinite-mode. If a\npage has been fetched, you can use ``getPage`` directly with the page number, an\nerror will be thrown if the page has not been fetched yet.\n\nBy default, ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` parses the response headers to find\nout what the ``first``, ``last``, ``next`` and ``prev`` links are. The parsed\nlinks are available in the ``links`` field.\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n   var Issues = Backbone.PageableCollection.extend({\n     url: \"https://api.github.com/repos/documentclound/backbone/issues?state=closed\",\n     mode: \"infinite\"\n\n     // Initial pagination states\n     state: {\n       pageSize: 15,\n       sortKey: \"updated\",\n       order: 1\n     },\n\n     // You can remap the query parameters from ``state`` keys from the default\n     // to those your server supports. Setting ``null`` on queryParams removed them\n     // from being appended to the request URLs.\n     queryParams: {\n       totalPages: null,\n       totalRecords: null,\n       sortKey: \"sort\",\n       order: \"direction\",\n       directions: {\n         \"-1\": \"asc\",\n         \"1\": \"desc\"\n       }\n     }\n\n   });\n\n   var issues = new Issues();\n\n   issues.getFirstPage().done(function () {\n      // do something interesting...\n   });\n\nIf your server API does not return the links using the ``Link`` header like\n`Github <http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination>`_ does, you can subclass\n``Backbone.PageableCollection`` to override the ``parseLinks`` methods to\nreturn a links object.\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n   var FBComment = Backbone.Model.extend({});\n\n   var FBComments = Backbone.PageableCollection.extend({\n     model: FBComment,\n     url: \"https://graph.facebook.com/A_REALLY_LONG_FACEBOOK_OBJECT_ID\",\n     mode: \"infinite\",\n     // Set the indices to 0-based for Graph API.\n     state: {\n       firstPage: 0\n     },\n     queryParams: {\n       pageSize: \"limit\",\n       // Setting a parameter mapping value to null removes it from the query string\n       currentPage: null,\n       // Any extra query string parameters are sent as is, values can be functions,\n       // which will be bound to the pageable collection instance temporarily\n       // when called.\n       offset: function () { return this.state.currentPage * this.state.pageSize; }\n     },\n     // Return all the comments for this Facebook object\n     parse: function (resp) {\n       return resp.comments;\n     },\n     // Facebook's `paging` object is in the exact format\n     // `Backbone.PageableCollection` accepts.\n     parseLinks: function (resp, xhr) {\n       return resp.comments.paging;\n     }\n   });\n\n\nSorting\n-------\n\nSorting has been drastically simplified in the 1.0 release while retaining the\nfull power it had in older versions.\n\nThe main way to define a sorting for a pageable collection is to utilize the\n``setSorting`` method.  Given a ``sortKey`` and an ``order``, ``setSorting``\nsets ``state.sortKey`` and ``state.order`` to the given values. If ``order`` is\nnot given, ``state.order`` is assumed. By default a comparator is applied to the\nfull collection under client mode. Calling ``sort`` on the full collection will\nthen get the entire pageable collection sorted globally. When operating under\nserver or infinite mode, no comparator will be applied to the collection as\nsorting is assumed to be done on the server by default. Set ``options.full`` to\n``false`` to apply a comparator to the current page under any mode. To sort a\npageable collection under infinite mode on the client side, set ``options.side``\nto ``\"client\"`` will apply a comparator to the full collection.\n\nSetting ``sortKey`` to ``null`` removes the comparator from both the current\npage and the full collection.\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n   var books = new Books([\n     ...\n   ], {\n     mode: \"client\"\n   });\n\n   // Sets a comparator on `#fullCollection` that sorts the title in ascending\n   // order\n   books.setSorting(\"title\");\n\n   // Don't forget to call `sort` just like you would on a `Backbone.Collection`\n   books.fullCollection.sort();\n\n   // Clears the comparator\n   books.setSorting(null);\n\n   // Sets a comparator on the current page that sorts the title in descending\n   // order\n   books.setSorting(\"title\", 1, {full: false})\n   books.sort();\n\n   books.switchMode(\"infinite\");\n\n   // Sorts the books collection under infinite paging mode on the client side\n   books.setSorting(\"title\", -1, {side: \"client\"});\n   books.fullCollection.sort();\n\n   books.switchMode(\"server\");\n\n   // Sets a comparator on the current page under server mode\n   books.setSorting(\"title\", {side: \"client\", full: false});\n   books.sort();\n\nManipulation\n------------\n\nThis is one of the areas where ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` truely shines. A\n``Backbone.PageableCollection`` instance not only can do everything a plain\n``Backbone.Collection`` can for the current page, in client-mode, it can also\nsynchronize changes and events across all of the pages. For example, you can add\nor remove a model from either a ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` instance, which\nis holding the current page, or the\n``Backbone.PageableCollection#fullCollection`` collection, which is a plain\n``Backbone.Collection`` holding the models for all of the pages, and the pages\nwill all update themselves to maintain within a page size. Any additions,\nremovals, resets, model attribute changes and synchronization actions are\ncommunicated between all the pages throught the two collections.\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n   // The books collection is initialized to start at the first page.\n   var books = new Books([\n     // bootstrap with all of the models for all of the pages here\n   ], {\n     mode: \"client\"\n   });\n\n   // A book is added to the end of the current page, which will overflow to the\n   // next page and trigger an `add` event on `fullCollection`.\n   books.push({ name: \"The Great Gatsby\"});\n\n   books.fullCollection.at(books.state.currentPage - 1 * books.state.pageSize).get(\"name\");\n   >>> \"The Great Gatsby\"\n\n   // Add a new book to the beginning of the first page.\n   books.fullCollection.unshift({ name: \"Oliver Twist\" });\n   books.at(0).get(\"name\");\n   >>> \"Oliver Twist\"\n\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nSee `here <http://wyuenho.github.com/backbone-pageable/>`_.\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n#. Why another paginator?\n\n   This project was born out of the needs for a backing model for\n   `Backgrid.Paginator <http://wyuenho.github.com/backgrid/#api-paginator>`_ -\n   an extension for the `Backgrid.js <http://wyuenho.github.com/backgrid/>`_\n   project. The project needed a smart and intuitive model that is\n   well-documented and well-tested to manage the paginator view. Upon examining\n   the popular project `Backbone.Paginator\n   <https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone.paginator/>`_, the author has\n   concluded that it does not satisfy the above requirements. Furthermore, the\n   progress of the the project is too slow. The author hopes to reinvent a\n   better wheel that is better suited and supported for `Backgrid.js\n   <http://wyuenho.github.com/backgrid/>`_.\n\n#. Which package managers does backbone-pageable support?\n\n   bower, CommonJS and AMD as of 0.9.0.\n\n#. Why doesn't backbone-pageable support filtering?\n\n   Wheels should be reinvented only when they are crooked. backbone-pageable aims\n   to do one thing only and does it well, which is pagination and sorting. Besides,\n   since Backbone.PageableCollection is 100% compatible with Backbone.Collection,\n   you can do filtering fairly easily with Backbone's built-in support for\n   Underscore.js methods.\n\nChange Log\n----------\n\n1.1.6\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - Fixed bug where a page of models disappeared after adding an array of\n      models to the current page under client mode. `(Issue #43)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/43>`_.\n\n1.1.5\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - Add event handlers should be triggered before remove handlers during\n      client mode. `(Issue #42)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/42>`_.\n\n1.1.4\n  Changes\n    - Dropped Backbone 0.9.2 support\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - TypeError thrown when adding a model to an empty client mode\n      collection. `(Issue #38)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/38>`_.\n    - Adding with an index inserts into the wrong page under client\n      mode. `(Issue #39)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/39>`_.\n\n1.1.3\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - Updating after fetching under infinite mode should not create useless\n      ``add``, ``remove`` and ``sort`` events. `(Issue #34)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/34>`_.\n    - RangeError when emptying fullCollection during reset `(Issue #37)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/37>`_.\n\n1.1.2\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - Fix off by 1 error with ``hasNext`` and ``hasPrevious`` `(Issue #32)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/32>`_.\n\n1.1.1\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - Fix regression where ``fetch`` errors out if ``url`` is a function `(Issue\n      #30) <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/30>`_.\n    - Fix temperatory state inconsistency when accessing ``state`` in event\n      handlers during client mode. `(Issue #27)\n      <https://github.com/wyuenho/backbone-pageable/issues/27>`_.\n\n1.1\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - Lots of fixes for infinite paging.\n    - Fixed incompatibility with Zepto.\n  Enhancements\n    - Introduced ``hasPrevious`` and ``hasNext`` for checking if the pageable\n      collection can be paged backward or forward.\n    - Tested against Backbone 0.9.10, jQuery 1.9 and Zepto 1.0rc1.\n\n1.0\n  Bugs Fixed\n    - Regression from 0.9.9 where ``mode`` wasn't saved after called ``switchMode``.\n  Changed\n    - ``makeComparator`` has been renamed to ``_makeComparator`` and is now a\n      protected method.\n  Enhancements\n    - Improved infinite-mode.
